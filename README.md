# instant-messaging-application
A simple chat application using Node.js, Socket.IO, and MongoDB.

Interface of the appliaction is designed on HTML and CSS. Node.js creates the server, handles the requests to the server, stores the data (username and messages entered by the user) on MongoDB, and sends data back to the clients.
Socket.IO is an event-based, bi-directional communication layer for realtime web applications. It abstracts many transports, including AJAX long-polling and WebSockets, into a single API.
